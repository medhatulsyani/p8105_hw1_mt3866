## Problem 1

``` r
library(moderndive)
```

``` r
library(tidyverse) 
```

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
```

The variable names in this dataset are origin, year, month, day, hour,
temp, dewp, humid, wind_dir, wind_speed, wind_gust, precip, pressure,
visib, time_hour. The dataset has 358 observations and 15 variables. The
mean of the temperature in the dataset is 39.5821229.

``` r
    ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color=humid)) + geom_point()
```

``` r
ggsave("hw1plot.pdf", height = 4, width = 6) 
```

In this plot, you can see that as the time_hour increases the
temperature generally increases in a zig-zag pattern, with the exception
of a sudden drop at the end.

## Problem 2

``` r
hw1_df=
  tibble(
    numeric_samp = rnorm(10),
    greater_0 = numeric_samp > 0,
    vec_char = c("My", "homework", "assignment", "should", "have", "a", "character", "length", "of", "ten"),
    vec_factor = factor (c("low", "low", "low", "medium", "medium", "medium", "high", "high", "high", "high"))
  )
```

The mean of the random sample in my new dataframe is -0.2025838.

The mean of the logical variable in my new dataframe is 0.3.

The mean of the character variable in my new dataframe is NA.

The mean of the factor variable in my new dataframe is NA.

Taking the mean of random and logical variables work, but taking the
mean of character and factor variables do not.

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,greater_0))
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_char))
```

    ## Warning: NAs introduced by coercion

``` r
as.numeric(pull(hw1_df,vec_factor))
```

When I used the as.numeric function, it converts the logical variables
and factor variables to numerical values, but leaves the character
variables as “NA”. This explains why the mean of my character variables
was NA. I noted that for my factor variables it assigned 3 of the same
number for low, 3 of the same number for medium, and 4 of the same
number for high when converting to numeric values. I also noted that my
logical variables consisted of only 0s and 1s, which explains why the
mean for my logical variables was between 0 and 1.
